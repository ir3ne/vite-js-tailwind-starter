### Usage notes

This project uses [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io) as package manager and enforces its use.

To install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

To prevent accidental usage of npm or yarn, the project includes a preinstall script using `only-allow`.
If you try to install with another package manager, the process will fail with an informative error.
